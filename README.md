# HelloGithub
Gitting familiar with GitHub
I could write:  Aspiring Junior Developer with strengths in understanding algorithms, advanced programming concepts and logic.
I'm really just a dude who wants to write some code. My resume will establlish that I know my way around a workplace and I received some good grades at college.  My previous employers will all say they enjoyed my tenure and were sorry to see me go.  My references will use terms like reliable, trustworthy, charismatic, smart.  But where is the code?  Where in there is some actual code!!!
